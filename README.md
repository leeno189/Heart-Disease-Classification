# Heart-Disease-Classification
I developed a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. I explored two different feature selection techniques (SelectKBest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)) followed by balancing the data using SMOTE. Four classifiers were trained and evaluated.
